    <h1>Hi Sharon!</h1>
    <div class="para">
      <p>It's been a long week and I really want you to know that I enjoyed collaborating with 
          you on our corporate achievement for this week. 
      </p>
      <p>I hope we meet again soon and wish you the very best.</p>
      <p>While I feel greatly impressed with your calmness, resourcefulness, professionalism and adept skills,
          Microverse has required that we finish the week with this bug hunting spree.<br>
          Here are a few tips though:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I should have about 5 more similar divs below and I have used JavaScript Object to create them.</li>
        <li>I had used loops for the creation</li>
        <li>You can only read this just when you fix this except with the Developer Tools</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Can you find my bug please?</p>
